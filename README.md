2. Firebase was a company founded in 2011 that made backend software. It was sold to Google in 2014. Firebase allows users to both build and run their websites from their site. They allow you to build AI-powered experiences into your apps and sites. The infrastructure used by Firebase is Google Cloud. Firebase claims it is easy to integrate iOS, Android, and the web. They provide detailed documentation and cross-platform SDKs for building apps. We use it because it provides plenty of documentation and instructions, it is easy to use, offers many tools to users, and is trusted by many of the largest apps such as The New York Times, Halfbrick Studios, Duolingo, and Venmo. It fits with my app from dev-mary because I could use Firebase to host and further improve my app. I could integrate tools like Google Ads, BigQuery, and Android Studio from Firebase.
